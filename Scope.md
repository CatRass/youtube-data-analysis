# Minimum viable product:
Python script that calculates total watchtime for as large of a period as possible, using either the API or the takeout JSON file, which ever allows for more data to be accessed. Graphical representation of watchtime over time.

# Scope
_Italics_ indicate optionality. **Bold** indicates possible lack of feasibility.

Python/command line tool to interface with individual aspects of functionality

and/or an **exe file**

it will _do a little searching to find the appropriate file_ if using takeout
